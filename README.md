## :star2: About the Project

The "Deliveroo" app is a React Native Expo application for food delivery. It utilizes a variety of technologies to create a comprehensive solution. Here's an overview of the project:

**Project Description:**
The "Deliveroo" app aims to provide a seamless food delivery experience to users. It offers a range of screens to facilitate different functionalities, including:

1. Splash Screen: The initial screen that appears when the app is launched, providing branding and loading indicators.

2. Login and Signup Screens: These screens enable users to create accounts or authenticate themselves to access personalized features.

3. Dashboard Screen: The main screen of the app where users can browse and search for available restaurants, explore menu items, and place orders.

4. Basket Screen: This screen displays the items added to the user's basket, allowing them to review and modify their order before proceeding to checkout.

5. Profile Screen: Users can manage their personal information, view order history, and customize their preferences on this screen.

6. Restaurant Screen: Provides detailed information about a specific restaurant, including its menu, reviews, and location.

7. Delivery Screen: Displays the status and progress of the user's ongoing food delivery, including estimated arrival time and tracking information.

**Technologies Used:**
The "Deliveroo" app incorporates the following technologies into its development stack:

1. React Native: A popular JavaScript framework for building native mobile applications.

2. Expo: A set of tools and services that simplifies the development of React Native applications.

3. Firebase: A comprehensive platform for building mobile and web applications, used for authentication, data storage, and file storage.

4. Node.js: A server-side JavaScript runtime that powers the backend server of the app, handling authentication, data retrieval, and server-side operations.

5. GraphQL: A query language and runtime that enables efficient communication between the client and server, reducing unnecessary data transfers and improving performance.

6. React Redux: A state management library that helps manage the app's global state and facilitates data flow between components.

7. React Navigation: A routing and navigation library for React Native that allows seamless navigation between different screens.

8. Tailwind CSS (Nativewind): A utility-first CSS framework used for styling the app's user interface.

By leveraging these technologies, the "Deliveroo" app provides a feature-rich and user-friendly food delivery experience. The combination of React Native, Expo, Firebase, Node.js, GraphQL, React Redux, React Navigation, and Tailwind CSS contributes to the app's robustness, performance, and efficient data communication.
